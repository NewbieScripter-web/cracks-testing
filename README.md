# Bypassed the "run with the loader thingy" (needs to run Infinite Yield first to work)
IY :
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EdgeIY/infiniteyield/master/source"))()
```
# Got the source
# Deleted webhooks :)
Run the script by copying below:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NewbieScripter-web/cracks-testing/refs/heads/main/Loader.luau", true))()
```



(Dead rails for the moment)
